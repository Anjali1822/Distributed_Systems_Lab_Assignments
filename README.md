# Distributed Systems Lab Assignment

This repository contains implementations of various distributed systems concepts as per the SPPU Distributed Systems 2019 pattern.

## Assignment List

1. **RMI Communication**: Implement multi-threaded client/server Process communication using RMI.
  
2. **CORBA Object Brokering**: Develop any distributed application using CORBA to demonstrate object brokering.
(Calculator or String operations).
 
3. **Distributed Sum Calculation**: Develop a distributed system, to find sum of N elements in an array by distributing N/n elements to n
number of processors MPI or OpenMP. Demonstrate by displaying the intermediate sums calculated
at different processors.

4. **Berkeley Algorithm**: Implement Berkeley algorithm for clock synchronization
 
5. **Token Ring Mutual Exclusion**: Implementation of a token ring-based mutual exclusion algorithm.
  
6. **Leader Election Algorithms**: Implementation of Bully and Ring algorithms for leader election.
 
7. **Simple Web Service**: Create a simple web service and write any distributed application to consume the web service

Please refer to each directory for detailed instructions and implementations.
